WWIC 
=============================================================================

WWIC (When Was I Compiled) is a simple tool to quickly check when a
Windows executable or library was compiled. It does this by reading
the PE header's `TimeDateStamp` field. Nothing more, nothing less,
just wanted a quick way to read this value.
